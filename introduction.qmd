## 1.1 What is the Rhizosphere?
Plant health and growth is largely dependent on its environment and interactions with its surroundings. Root systems rely on water, nutrients, and microorganisms in their diverse soil environments to maintain overall health. These factors are vital for plant health as plants need proper nutrition and hydration to grow and reproduce. 

The area that contains the most dynamic interaction between plant roots and their soil environments is called the rhizosphere. The rhizosphere is the thin region of soil surrounding plant root systems, and is often referred to as the root microbiome (see @fig-rhizosphere). It is a dynamic environment, with constant interaction between the roots and soil. Among these interactions are nutrient cycling, water absorption, root secretions, and microbial activity. These interactions can increase overall plant health, soil fertility, and plant pathogen resistance.

Key aspects of the interface between roots and soil include “the release of organic materials from roots, microbial colonisation of roots, root associated nitrogen fixation[...]and interactions between root pathogens and root functioning” [@rovira_biology_1979]. The Monitoring the Rhizosphere projects proposes using light interference to examine these aspects of the rhizosphere.

## 1.2 What is light interference?
The immense speed of light often poses a great challenge in directly measuring the passage of a light wave. Interference provides a way to indirectly measure light through shifts in phase caused by differences in light wave path lengths. The interference of waves refers to the superposition of waves on top of each other that can increase or decrease the resulting wave’s amplitude. When the sinusoidal patterns of the light waves are “in phase” (line up with each other), the waves interfere constructively to create one wave with an increased amplitude. When the sinusoidal patterns are “out of phase” (not lined up), the waves interfere destructively to create one wave with a decreased amplitude (see @fig-interference).

Although light interference is described by the superposition of the electric fields of light waves, contemporary instruments built for measuring light interference patterns can only capture the time average intensity of the interference signal. @eq-intensity depicts the intensity formula characterized by the interference between a sample and reference beam and is derived from the squared amplitude of the summation between both beams’ complex electric fields (see Appendix B for derivation).

$$
I_{measured} = |E_{s} + E_{r}|^2 = I_{s}^2 + I_{r}^2 + I_{s}I_{r}cos(\Delta \phi)
$$ {#eq-intensity}

The measured intensity allows for the determination of the phase difference between the beams and thus the path length difference between the beams. The phase can be modulated in a lab setting using an optical instrument known as an Electrical Optical Modulator (EOM) that adds a phase to a signal based on an input voltage to the instrument. The use of the EOM in our setup proved difficult due to inconsistencies with the phase output of the EOM from extreme sensitivity to small changes in the lab environment (see Appendix C for details).

## 1.3 What is light coherence?
The coherence of a light source determines how close the path lengths of each beam need to be in order to produce a measurable interference signal. Coherence length refers to the length at which the interference signal can be resolved. The longer the coherence length, the greater the path length difference can be while still producing a visible interference signal. Thus, coherence length is inversely	related to the resolution of the system. The coherence length of a source can be calculated using the full width at half maximum of the source’s emission spectrum and the source’s nominal wavelength (see @eq-cohlength).

$$
L_{coherence} = \frac{\lambda_{nominal}^2}{\Delta \lambda}
$$ {#eq-cohlength}

The most common source used in standard interferometer setups is a monochromatic light source like a laser (see @fig-laser), but for sensitive depth measurements, near-infrared Super Luminescent Diodes (SLDs) have shorter coherence lengths (in the tens of micrometers) that allow for higher resolution (see @fig-sld).

SLDs are often implemented in low-coherence interferometry (LCI) systems to visualize interference only when the path length difference between beams are within a few wavelengths of each other. The backscattered light provides a scan of the sample by sweeping a reference mirror to match the path length of light off any reflective surfaces in the sample (see @fig-lci). 

![A basic setup for a low coherence interferometry system.](spielci.png){#fig-lci}

The ability to scan the depth of reflective surfaces in a sample promotes light as a prospective solution to measuring plant root systems in a non-invasive and accessible way. The existing methods for imaging root systems are impractical to adopt for large-scale practices either due to the need for lab controlled environments, uprooting of the plant, or high costs. One such method is growing the plant in a clear medium like agar to view the root system, but only select plants are capable of growing in these mediums. PET imaging (positron emission tomography) is another current solution but requires removing the plant and slicing the sample in order to image the inside of the stem and roots. To combat the selectiveness of the clear medium and invasiveness of the PET imaging, the last common method is to grow the plant in a rhizotron, which is a windowed box in which the root system can be viewed in an underground lab. These rhizotrons can range up to $40,000 to operate and so are not accessible for widespread implementation. In this paper, we propose an optical tool that leverages the light-piping properties of plant root systems and low coherence interferometry to noninvasively and accessibly monitor root characteristics and overall plant health.  

Our paper will cover why the Arabidopsis plant was chosen for experimentation, the low coherence interferometer materials and setup, the instruments used to process data, the software for collecting and further processing of data, what results were collected from the data, and our findings and conclusions of the results in the application of low coherence interferometry in monitoring root systems.
