    "text": "Abstract\nThe ability to track the growth and health of crops is essential to the agriculture industry. The health, productivity, and reproduction of these crops often rely on the proper acquisition of nutrients and water, as well as the interactions between microorganisms and the soil surrounding the roots, known as the rhizosphere. Conventional methods of monitoring the rhizosphere and plant root systems are expensive, invasive, and difficult to reproduce on a large scale. These methods include taking positron emission tomography (PET) scans of plants, growing plants in clear mediums, or observing roots through rhizotron windows. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an alternative approach that seeks to exploit the light-piping properties of fine taproot systems as observed in Arabidopsis plants to be able to map these root systems in situ. A low-coherence interferometric (LCI) system, built with an 850 nm super luminescent diode, is used to measure the backscattered light from Arabidopsis roots with a coherence window of 13 µm. The path-length-resolved backscatter signal provides a functional measurement that represents changes in the root’s structure, such as bends, branches, or breaks, and may also indicate the maturity, complexity, and longitudinal growth of the root system. This paper will describe the system architecture and design, along with preliminary characterization and experimental data."

    "section": "1.2 What is light interference?",
    "text": "1.2 What is light interference?\nThe immense speed of light often poses a great challenge in directly measuring the passage of a light wave. Interference provides a way to indirectly measure light through shifts in phase caused by differences in light wave path lengths. The interference of waves refers to the superposition of waves on top of each other that can increase or decrease the resulting wave’s amplitude. When the sinusoidal patterns of the light waves are “in phase” (line up with each other), the waves interfere constructively to create one wave with an increased amplitude. When the sinusoidal patterns are “out of phase” (not lined up), the waves interfere destructively to create one wave with a decreased amplitude (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Diagram depicting completely constructive and completely destructive interference of waves (“Constructive and Destructive Interference - Students  Britannica Kids  Homework Help” n.d.).\n\n\n\nAlthough light interference is described by the superposition of the electric fields of light waves, contemporary instruments built for measuring light interference patterns can only capture the time average intensity of the interference signal. Equation 1 depicts the intensity formula characterized by the interference between a sample and reference beam and is derived from the squared amplitude of the summation between both beams’ complex electric fields (see Appendix B for derivation).\n\\[\nI_{measured} = |E_{s} + E_{r}|^2 = I_{s}^2 + I_{r}^2 + I_{s}I_{r}cos(\\Delta \\phi)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe measured intensity allows for the determination of the phase difference between the beams and thus the path length difference between the beams. The phase can be modulated in a lab setting using an optical instrument known as an Electrical Optical Modulator (EOM) that adds a phase to a signal based on an input voltage to the instrument. The use of the EOM in our setup proved difficult due to inconsistencies with the phase output of the EOM from extreme sensitivity to small changes in the lab environment (see Appendix C for details).",

    "section": "1.3 What is light coherence?",
    "text": "1.3 What is light coherence?\nThe coherence of a light source determines how close the path lengths of each beam need to be in order to produce a measurable interference signal. Coherence length refers to the length at which the interference signal can be resolved. The longer the coherence length, the greater the path length difference can be while still producing a visible interference signal. Thus, coherence length is inversely related to the resolution of the system. The coherence length of a source can be calculated using the full width at half maximum of the source’s emission spectrum and the source’s nominal wavelength (see Equation 2).\n\\[\nL_{coherence} = \\frac{\\lambda_{nominal}^2}{\\Delta \\lambda}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nThe most common source used in standard interferometer setups is a monochromatic light source like a laser (see Figure 3 (a)), but for sensitive depth measurements, near-infrared Super Luminescent Diodes (SLDs) have shorter coherence lengths (in the tens of micrometers) that allow for higher resolution (see Figure 3 (b)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The emission spectra of a laser (Jia et al. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The optical spectra of a super-luminescent diode (SLD) (Chen et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Comparison between spectra for a laser and an SLD source.\n\n\n\nSLDs are often implemented in low-coherence interferometry (LCI) systems to visualize interference only when the path length difference between beams are within a few wavelengths of each other. The backscattered light provides a scan of the sample by sweeping a reference mirror to match the path length of light off any reflective surfaces in the sample (see Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A basic setup for a low coherence interferometry system.\n\n\n\nThe ability to scan the depth of reflective surfaces in a sample promotes light as a prospective solution to measuring plant root systems in a non-invasive and accessible way. The existing methods for imaging root systems are impractical to adopt for large-scale practices either due to the need for lab controlled environments, uprooting of the plant, or high costs. One such method is growing the plant in a clear medium like agar to view the root system, but only select plants are capable of growing in these mediums. PET imaging (positron emission tomography) is another current solution but requires removing the plant and slicing the sample in order to image the inside of the stem and roots. To combat the selectiveness of the clear medium and invasiveness of the PET imaging, the last common method is to grow the plant in a rhizotron, which is a windowed box in which the root system can be viewed in an underground lab. These rhizotrons can range up to $40,000 to operate and so are not accessible for widespread implementation. In this paper, we propose an optical tool that leverages the light-piping properties of plant root systems and low coherence interferometry to noninvasively and accessibly monitor root characteristics and overall plant health.\nOur paper will cover why the Arabidopsis plant was chosen for experimentation, the low coherence interferometer materials and setup, the instruments used to process data, the software for collecting and further processing of data, what results were collected from the data, and our findings and conclusions of the results in the application of low coherence interferometry in monitoring root systems.",

    "text": "4.2 LCI Setup\nThe results of the stage sweeps for the Low Coherence Interferometer setup suggest that we are not sweeping a large enough range to visualize an interference peak. From position -25 to 25 there appears to be an increasing trend towards the end, zooming out to range -100 to 100 shows no increasing pattern. Because the test results were inconclusive in detecting an interference pattern, future iterations of sweep testing call for capturing the complete range of the translation stage. Due to complications with the size of the full range data, the next steps are to scan the whole range in sizable chunks that the program can save. A further issue that may interfere with accuracy in scanning the whole range in parts is that the piezo motor works with open-loop control meaning that the motor moves based on a set zero position from the user and does not internally determine the zero. This means that the position reported from the piezo motor is susceptible to changes in absolute distance. This issue could be resolved by connecting the piezo motor to a distance sensor to create a closed-loop controlled system. We also aim to conduct a noise analysis of the system by measuring the photodiode’s dark current noise and the shot noise of the system. For dark current noise analysis, we will take multiple trials with the laser and lights off to measure the photodiode’s variance in darkness. For shot noise, we will capture multiple trials with the stage at a constant position to measure the noise that originates from the discrete nature of electrical charge.",

    "text": "2.1 Arabidopsis Setup\nArabidopsis thaliana was used as a plant model for integration into the low-coherence interferometry setup. Arabidopsis is a model organism, meaning that the majority of gene families present in the Arabidopsis genome are present in other flowering plants, thus their gene functions are often similar (see Figure 1). This means that conclusions drawn from research utilizing Arabidopsis as a model organism are often applicable to other flowering plants (Woodward and Bartel 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A diagram demonstrating the overlap between gene families of Arabidopsis and other similar flowering plants. Approximately two-thirds of Arabidopsis gene families overlap between all of these plant species (Paterson et al. 2009).\n\n\n\nArabidopsis also has a characteristic root structure that integrates well with the interferometry setup, which is a larger, primary root with smaller roots branching off (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A scanned image of Arabidopsis roots grown in a Standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duan, Sebastian, and Dinneny 2015).\n\n\n\nIn the low-coherence interferometry setup, a section of the primary root will be used such that the near-infrared beam may pass through the single root. This allows for examination of the light-piping properties of a single Arabidopsis root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The drawn out protocol for growing the Arabidoposis roots in a wet lab.\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 3, preparing liquid media for plant growth required 0.43 grams of Murashige & Skoog (MS) basal salt media, and 2 grams of sucrose to be mixed into a 25lmL beaker containing 100mL MQ water using a stir bar. Using a pH probe, 0.1M KOH was added until the solution was a pH of 6.0, 4 grams of agar powder, 100mL MQ water, and 0.1M KOH added dropwise for pH adjustment to 6.0, since optimal pH range for plant growth is 6.0-7.5. After pH adjustment, this solution was added to a 150mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 4g of LB agar powder, mixed, and autoclaved for 20 minutes on a liquid cycle.\nAfter sterilization in the autoclave, the 100mLs of liquid media were poured into four clean plates in a sterile environment before being covered with an opaque material and allowed to set and cool overnight. The next morning they were placed upside-down in a refrigerator at 4°C for 24 hours.\nArabidopsis seeds were rinsed in a seed sterilization buffer containing 50μL of 10X Triton (diluted from 100X Triton) and 10mL of 70% ethanol. They were then rinsed twice in MQ water before being plated onto the agar plates. Six seeds were placed on each plate and they were left to germinate at 4°C in the dark for 1-2 days before being incubated in a Vivosun growth chamber at 21-22°C, 65-70% humidity, and a 12 hours light/12 hours dark light cycle. The plants continued to grow on agar plates. The Vivosun growth chamber elements used were a 2x2 growth tent, the AeroStream U075 750ml USB Humidifier, and the AeroWave D4 4” clip fan, as well as a Bluetooth thermometer/hygrometer (see Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The plant growth tent setup used to house the seeded agar plates. The setup includes a reflective tent, a fan, an overhanging light, and a humidifier sourced from Vivosun.

    "text": "2.2 LCI Setup\n\n2.2.1 Interferometer Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A drawing of the Low Coherence Interferometer (LCI) setup with an 850 nm super luminescent diode (SLD) feeding into a polarizer, then split 50:50 by a 2x2 coupler into a sample and reference beam that when reflected recombine into the photodiode (PD). The signal is then fed into a photodiode amplifier (PA), read by the data acquistion device (NiDAQ), and saved on the computer through code.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the interferometry system used a super luminescent diode (SLD) with a nominal wavelength of 850 nm and maximum power of 20 mW as the broadband low coherence light source. This light was then fed into a 2x2 coupler via an FC/APC fiber that splits the incoming light 50:50 into a sample beam and a reference beam. The sample beam and reference beam were collimated using a fiber collimation package with a Numerical Aperture of 0.15 (NA = 0.15) and a focal length of 18.45 mm. The collimated reference beam enters free space and then is reflected off a total internal reflection (TIR) retroreflector back into the collimator and into the fiber. The collimated sample beam enters free space and is reflected back off the sample back into the fiber to then interfere with the returning reference beam. The combined beam returns to the 2x2 coupler where the beam is split 50:50 once more with half of the beam being sent back to the source and the other half of the beam being sent to a large area SI detector with an active area of 75.4 mm2 to measure the intensity of the interference signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A labeled picture of the in-lab LCI setup. The sample in this setup is a TIR retroreflection with an AR coating for 350-700 nm.\n\n\n\nWith the following setup pictured in Figure 6, the detector will only measure a peak in interference when the reference beam is within wavelengths with the light reflected from the sample. The reflected beam from each reflective surface of the sample can then be matched in path length by sweeping the reference mirror/retroreflector. Due to the SLD’s small coherence length of 13 um, the reference mirror needed to be on a programmable translation stage. An extra manual stage was added to the sample and underneath the translation stage holding the retroreflector for ease of alignment. Alignment of the reference retroflector required blocking the path between the output beam from the sample collimator path and the sample, tweaking the position and angle of the retroreflector, and using a power meter in place of the detector in order to visualize and maximize the power output from the reference beam. This process was then repeated for the sample beam by blocking the reference retroreflector instead. Initial sweeps were taken without the Arabidopsis root sample present to find the SLD’s small coherence length before testing with plant sample present.\nAll materials were sourced from Thorlabs.\n\n\n2.2.2 LCI Hardware\nThe data is measured as a voltage whereas we are concerned with the incident power onto the photodiode to delineate information about the intensity of the interference signal. The hardware is where the conversion from power to voltage occurs. This section depicts the conversion from the measured voltage back to incident power.\nThe setup uses a NiDAQ instrument to acquire the data as a measured voltage. The voltage signal (red cable) is connected to analog input AI1 whereas the reference ground (black cable) is connected to analog ground AIGND. The voltage signal and reference ground is collected from the photodiode amplifier.\nThe PDA200C Photodiode Amplifier (PA) reads the signal from a DET100A2 photodiode (PD) as a current and then outputs a voltage with a set conversion scale.\n\nPA Voltage to PD Current\nThe analog output of the PA conversion depends on the current range and resolution that is manually set on the PA (see Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Analog Output Conversion Table from PDA200C datasheet\n\n\n\nFor our setup, the PA was set to a resolution of 1 nA for a signal within the 10µA current range, meaning the Conversion Coeff used was 1x106 V/A. Using the conversion coefficient and the current range, we can calculate from the output voltage measured what the current seen on the PA is. Connecting to the PA with the PD darkened completely allows the PA to offset the dark current from the photodiode. Thus, the measured voltage can be converted directly to the PD current (Ipd) without needing to calculate the dark current.\n\n\nPD Current to Incident Power\nThe PA can directly convert to power but because the photodiode’s responsivity can change based on light wavelength, it is good to check the power with hand calculations. To calculate power from the PD, we estimate the responsivity from the DET100A2 datasheet for our SLD with wavelength of 850nm to be approximately 0.65.\nWe can then calculate power using the relationship between responsivity, Ipd, and power derived from the DET100A2 datasheet (see Equation 1).\n\\[\nP_{incident} = \\frac{R(\\lambda)}{I_{PD}}    \n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n2.2.3 LCI Software\nThe Python packages nidaqmx and pylablib were used to connect to the NiDAQ and the Kinetic Piezo motor that translates the stage housing the reference mirror back and forth. Initial data was taken on the NiDAQ with a sampling frequency of 1 MHz with 1000 samples per channel. Given a start and end positional value for the Kinesis Motor, the software program moved the motor from start to end position, pausing at each integer positional value to read all available samples in the NiDAQ channel. These samples would then be averaged and stored as the voltage of the interference signal at that motor position for the trial. For multiple trials, the program swept the reference mirror from start to end position before repeating the cycle from start to end position for the provided number of trials. The program then took the average and the standard deviation of the voltages stored at each position for each trial to produce a list of trial averaged voltages at each position, The program then plotted the trial averaged voltages with the standard deviation as error bars on a graph with the motor position as the independent axis and measured voltage as the dependent axis. With only one trial, the plot would be the averaged voltages of all the read samples for each position for the one trial with no error bars due to a standard deviation of zero.\n\n\nLCISweepCONTINUOUS.py\n\nfrom pylablib.devices import Thorlabs\nimport nidaqmx\nfrom nidaqmx.constants import TerminalConfiguration, AcquisitionType, READ_ALL_AVAILABLE\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport csv\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef create_folder(folder_name):\n    try:\n        os.mkdir(folder_name)\n        print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' created successfully.\")\n    except FileExistsError:\n        print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' already exists.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef move_to_folder(folder_name):\n    try:\n        os.chdir(folder_name)\n        print(f\"Current directory changed to: {os.getcwd()}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' not found.\")\n    except NotADirectoryError:\n        print(f\"'{folder_name}' is not a directory.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef create_csv_file(filename, fields, datarows):\n    with open(filename, 'w') as csvfile:\n        # create csv writer object\n        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, lineterminator='\\n')\n\n        # writing the fields\n        csvwriter.writerow(fields)\n\n        # writing the data rows\n        csvwriter.writerows(datarows)\n\ndef take_data():\n    with nidaqmx.Task() as task:\n        task.ai_channels.add_ai_voltage_chan(\"Dev1/ai1\", \n                                            max_val=10, \n                                            terminal_config= TerminalConfiguration.RSE)\n\n        task.timing.cfg_samp_clk_timing(1000000, \n                                        sample_mode=AcquisitionType.FINITE, \n                                        samps_per_chan=1000)\n        rawdata = task.read(READ_ALL_AVAILABLE)\n    return rawdata\n\ndef find_amp(data):\n    sorted_data = sorted(data)\n\n    # calculate minimum average of bottom 100 values\n    averagemin = np.mean(sorted_data[0:99])\n\n    # calculate maximum average of top 100 values\n    averagemax = np.mean(sorted_data[len(sorted_data)-100:len(sorted_data)])\n\n    # calculate amplitude\n    amplitude = averagemax -

    "text": "5.3 Appendix C: Electrical Optical Modulator (EOM) Setup and Results\nBefore implementing the low coherence interferometry (LCI) setup, a Michelson interferometry setup was used, where an electro-optic modulator (EOM) was used to alter the path length of the reference beam. This setup allowed for more sensitive measurements than directing the laser straight into the Arabidopsis root, but hypersensitivity of the setup became an issue as air flow and minute movement of the table the setup rested on were enough to interfere with the EOM setup. We saw this in large variations in data over different trials at the same input voltage (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The output interference signal of two different trials of the same input voltage into the EOM over multiple sweeps of input voltages showcase a large variance of the output signal among trials. The inability to map the voltage signal to a unique input voltage rendered the EOM setup unusable from the sensitivity.\n\n\n\nThe low-coherence interferometry setup was purused in the prospects of greater stability.",
