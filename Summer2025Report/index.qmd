This following website is a summary of progress on the Monitoring the Rhizosphere project for the Summer of 2025 including what steps to take next for continuation of the project. 

## Abstract
The ability to track the growth and health of crops is essential to the agriculture industry. The health, productivity, and reproduction of these crops often rely on the proper acquisition of nutrients and water, as well as the interactions between microorganisms and the soil surrounding the roots, known as the rhizosphere. Conventional methods of monitoring the rhizosphere and plant root systems are expensive, invasive, and difficult to reproduce on a large scale. These methods include taking positron emission tomography (PET) scans of plants, growing plants in clear mediums, or observing roots through rhizotron windows. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an alternative approach that seeks to exploit the light-piping properties of fine taproot systems as observed in Arabidopsis plants to be able to map these root systems in situ. A low-coherence interferometric (LCI) system, built with an 850 nm super luminescent diode, is used to measure the backscattered light from Arabidopsis roots with a coherence window of 13 µm. The path-length-resolved backscatter signal provides a functional measurement that represents changes in the root’s structure, such as bends, branches, or breaks, and may also indicate the maturity, complexity, and longitudinal growth of the root system. This paper will describe the system architecture and design, along with preliminary characterization and experimental data.
