Initial testing of the Low Coherence Interferometer setup involved placing a retroreflector in the sample position to check functionality and alignment of the system. Due to availability in the lab, a retroreflector with an AR coating for 350 nm to 700 nm was used. @fig-test1 depicts a sweep from stage position -100 to 100 while @fig-test3 depicts a sweep from stage position -25 to 25. Both sweeps had 5 trials and had a measured average photodiode current reading of approximately 16.00 uA throughout the test.

Data for different sweep ranges of the reference mirror stage.
:::

Each of the functionality tests had a measured voltage range no more than 5.0 mV above the minimum measured voltage. 

The translation stage had a maximum range of 50 mm with each step of the motor approximately 1 nm. To capture the full range, a sweep was run from position -50000000 nm to 50000000 nm. Unfortunately, the data captured could not be saved into a csv file due to having too large of a dataset. Results for a full sweep of the stage range are postponed until the next semester.
